### Context
Course ID: {course}

1. **Reddit data** â€“ every relevant post and top-level comment pulled from r/UCR.  
   â€¢ Each block starts with "POST:" or "COMMENT:".  
   â€¢ Up-votes are in square brackets, e.g. [â–²123] or [+45].  
   â€¢ Unix timestamp appears as (created_utc=â€¦).

2. **UCR Student Database reviews** â€“ JSON-like text that lists individual reviews, their `date`, `comments`, `individual_difficulty`, and the overall `average_difficulty`.

### Task
1. Read both data sets.  
2. **Prioritise newer items**: higher `created_utc` for Reddit, later `date` for database.  
3. Break ties with up-votes (Reddit) or `individual_difficulty` extremes (database).  
4. Ignore off-topic chatter, memes, or duplicates.  
5. **Capture both strengths and weaknesses** that appear repeatedly (â‰¥ 2 similar comments) and any strong minority views.  
6. ***Compute a 1â€“5-star rating for each professor***:  
   â€¢ 5 â˜… = overwhelmingly positive; 1 â˜… = overwhelmingly negative; 3 â˜… = mixed.  
   â€¢ Base the rating on the ratio of positive to negative comments.  
7. Write output with the exact markdown headings below. If a section has no info, keep the heading and write "No clear info."

### Output format (markdown)

#### Overall Sentiment
One-sentence vibe (e.g., "Mostly positive but time-consuming").

**Workload & Time Commitment:** Include specific details about hours per week, number of projects/exams, key pain points, and how time-consuming the course is.

#### Difficulty
â€“ Rank: *Easy / Moderate / Hard / Very Hard*  
â€“ 2-4 bullet points explaining why.

#### Professors & What Students Say
| Professor | â˜… Rating | Representative reviews<sup>â€ </sup> |
|-----------|---------|-------------------------------------|
| Name      | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†   | 1. ðŸ“Š 2024-11-15 â€“ "Engaging lectures but tough quizzes."<br>2. ðŸ‘½ 2025-03-02 â€“ "Clear grader, slides online." |

<sup>â€ </sup> Prefix each quote with **ðŸ“Š** if it came from the database or **ðŸ‘½** if from Reddit, and include the review date (YYYY-MM-DD).

#### Advice & Tips for Success
**COURSE-SPECIFIC ONLY:** List practical tips that are unique to this exact course/professors. Avoid generic advice like "study early," "stay organized," "attend lectures" - only include tips that are specific to this course's format, professors, exams, or unique requirements.

**Recommended Resources:** Include books, websites, videos, tutoring, and other helpful resources within this section.

#### Common Pitfalls
Top 3 mistakes students warn about.

#### Grade Distribution Perception
If discussed, summarise; else "No clear info."

### Style rules
- Plain English.  
- Bullets â‰¤ 20 words.  
- **Include positive and negative viewpoints.**  
- Each professor needs **at least two quotes** (one positive, one negative if available).  
- Quotes must show the review date and the correct icon (ðŸ“Š or ðŸ‘½).  
- Use Unicode stars (â˜…) for ratings.  
- No invented facts; if unsure, write "Not mentioned."  
- Do **not** mention Reddit, up-votes, JSON, or yourself.  
- **Maximum 4000 words** total.
- **IMPORTANT: Each section should be VERY detailed and comprehensive. Aim for 200-400 words per section.**
- **NO main title or heading at the top - start directly with the first section.**
- **MINORITY OPINIONS: If you find genuine minority opinions, integrate them into the appropriate sections using this format: "*Minority opinion: [opinion text]*" - only include when there are actual minority views, don't force them.**

### REDDIT DATA:
{formatted_reddit_data if formatted_reddit_data.strip() else "No Reddit discussions found for this course."}

### UCR DATABASE DATA:
{ucr_database_data if ucr_database_data.strip() else "No UCR database entries found for this course."}"""
